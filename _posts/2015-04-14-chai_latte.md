This delicious beverage is easy to make and so much better than what you would pay $5 for in many coffeeshops.

# Ingredients

# Preparation

1. Place the chai mix in a 2-cup teapot with a strainer.
1. Cover with hot water: basically boiling (95 Celsius) for black tea; boiling (100 Celsius) for rooibos.
1. Steep: 3 minutes for black tea; 6 minutes for rooibos.
1. Put some honey at the bottom of a mug and pour hot tea over it, leaving a generous amount of space for the milk.
1. Froth the milk and fill the mug.
1. Sprinkle with some cinnamon powder.
1. Enjoy!

# Notes

* Different types of milk and different frothers will yield different foamy milk.  Full cream homogenized milk seems to double in size after frothing, while fresh-from-the-cow unhomogenized milk gets only a hint of froth.  You may have to experiment with the right quantity of milk for your conditions.
* If you don't have a frother, you can always use plain milk and downgrade from "chai latte" to "chai au lait".  It's still delicious!
