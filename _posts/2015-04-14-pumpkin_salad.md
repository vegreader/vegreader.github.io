#### Preparation

1. Preheat the oven to 180 Celsius.
1. In a bowl, toss the oil, garlic, veggie salt and diced pumpkin.
1. Place the oily pumpkin in a baking dish and put in the hot oven.  Bake for 30-35 minutes, checking occasionally.  The pumpkin should become soft and get a dark brown roasted look.  When ready, take out of the oven and let it cool down a little bit.
1. In a serving bowl, break the salad into bite-size pieces.  Crumble some of the feta on top of the salad.
1. [Prepare the balsamic vinaigrette][balsamic_vinaigrette].
1. Put the pumpkin on the salad and crumble the rest of the feta on top of it.  Garnish with nuts and serve alongside the vinaigrette.
